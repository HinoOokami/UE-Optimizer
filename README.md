# UE-Optimizer
Optimizer for Unreal Engine based games

Optimizes some settings in UE .ini files on Windows platforms
by making changes proposed here: https://steamcommunity.com/app/200510/discussions/0/846960628563773260

It works by looking for .ini files for all UE based games in user/Documents folder,
making changes to them and setting Read Only attribute so games won't rollback changes.
